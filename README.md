Computer Shop Management System(C++ project)
A computer shop management system sells various types of hardware and software 
accessories such as Laptop, Antivirus and Keyboard etc. It’s very hard for the shopkeeper 
to remember their cost price and in what price these items to be sold. As the market goes 
up and down for various products daily, so there should be some proper medium through 
which prices of these items can be changed frequently without any problem. There are 
many customers who will make their payment online, so there should be a medium to 
take their credit card as input and reduce exact amount from their account. This computer 
shop management system will enable its user’s keep their customers report secure, so that 
next time these customers when arrive to their shop, do not have to enter their details 
again. Buyers will also able to select products options while purchasing through computer 
screen and can make their payment from that particular screen and pick up their 
materials which they have selected at the pickup center within the shop.
